Image Names
-----------

Provide a name generation and image derivation naming capability for reposity images


Image names convey the processing history of derived images.  The intent is that images are unique in the system,
although they may be cached at multiple levels.  If the name of two images is the same, they are guarenteeded to tbe the 
same image. This means that a request for a derived image can be made, and used to create the image name.  If there is 
an image with that name, it can be guarenteed to be the image needed.

class ImageName:
    """
    Encapsulates the name an individual image will have in whatever file repository is used.

    There will always be an original image - this is the the native image that was loaded.
    In general the original image will not be served from the repository, and images derived from it will be.
    Image names are required to encapsulate the information that is needed to create them from the original image.
    This allows any image caching layer to find a cached image simply by checking the names of images to see if
    any derivation step can be avoided.


    We must define a syntax for derived image names.
    All images are named from the original image with optional suffixes.  The suffix syntax must be
    unambiguous. This allows extention of the system to provide for caching of new processing steps.


    Format of base or derived image

    * Unique name for image source

        -     MD5 hash of base image (ie without metadata) = 32 hexadecimal digits
        -     Path name and unique name within psuedo directory

    * Optional derivation operations

        -    Plus ``+``
        -    operation: one of ``crop``, ``size``, ``thumbnail``, ``convert``, ``clone``, ``original``, ``metadata``
        -    open parenthesis ``(``
        -    parameters - comma separated list
        -   close parenthesis ``)``

    * dot ``.``
    * image format

    In principle multiple operations may be cascaded, although currently this feature isn't used by the
    client classes.  Mathematical purity would suggest that the apppication of image derivation steps is
    done in a heirarchical manner, of function applied to function application, but currently they are simply 
    appended.

    The operation ``original`` can't be combined with any other operation, it conveys the semantics that this image is 
    the unchanged original uploaded image. 

    The ``clone`` operation should never actually appear in the wild, and is a placeholder for internal use to avoid any
    potential problems with aliasing of images whilst derivation steps occur.

    The ``metadata`` operator does not yield an image
