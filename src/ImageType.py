Image Handling
--------------

Encapsulates images and the processing of images.  Further, associates images
with ImageNames, and interfaces with Cache implementations.

Provides for lazy generation and importation of images in an attempt to avoid or
spread out cost of moving data.

Images are managed by the Wand library, which itslef provides a layer over the ImageMagik image
processing libraries.
